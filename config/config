# Global configuration file for smartvolume
# You can copy this and any other configuration file to ~/.config/smartvolume if necessary
# You can also create a local version and only change the relevant lines.

# Load the following volume modules (separated by spaces), and run them in order shown, stopping after first success
# e.g. with "mpdpy alsa", smartvolume will consider itself "done" and exit if mpdpy decides to run, and is successful
# (in this case, if mpd is playing), and if mpdpy doesn't alter volume for whatever reason, alsa will run next.
# you can use "smartvolume list vol" to get a list of all modules and their descriptions
modules = 

# The percentage of volume to adjust by
# 3%, 5% and 10% are sane values, though it will take anything from 1-100
volume = 5
